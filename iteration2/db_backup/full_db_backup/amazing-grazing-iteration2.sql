The desert bighorn sheep, for example, gets most of its water from eating plants. Like all ruminants, they have multi-chambered stomachs that are adapted to ferment cellulose before digestion.

How much is too little? That depends on the type of grassland and its location, but grasslands in general get around 50 to 90 centimeters of annual rainfall.

Wool fiber can withstand being bent 20,000 times without breaking. In comparison, cotton breaks after 3,000 bends and silk after 2,000 bends.

Australia’s 7.7 million square kilometres support a wide range of agricultural and forestry industries.

Competitive pressures drive the need for improved productivity, which includes increased diversification and intensification.

They feed on a range of different types of grasses, depending on climate and region. In Australia, cattle are predominantly grass fed and account for around 2/3 of whole beef production on average. Grain fed beef comes from cattle which are fed grass for most of their lives and then transition to grain-based diets for the remainder of their lives. The number of days during which they are fed a grain-based diet varies.</h5><p></p><h5 class=\"text-justify\">Livestock are fed grain for several reasons, including to maintain a consistent meat supply, improve eating quality, meet specific needs for niche markets (e.g. for highly marbled meat), meet the energy needs of animals when pasture is limited (such as in drought conditions) and increase animal size.</h5>'),

Around 172,000 people are employed in the red meat industry, including on-farm production, processing and retail. In 2018-2019, Australia produced approximately 2.35 million tones carcass weight (cwt) of beef and veal. In 2018-2019, 3.14 million grain fed cattle were marketed 38% of all adult cattle slaughtered. On the other hand, the gross value of Australian cattle and calf production (including live cattle exports) in 2018-19 is estimated at A$10.9 billion.

Wool-made yarn is also one of the most sought after recycled textiles for converting into new long-lasting products, such as garments, mattresses and upholstery. In contrast to synthetics, wool-made yarn can absorb moisture vapour which means less sweat on your body.  Wool-made yarn even absorbs the odour molecules from sweat, which are only released upon washing. Wool-made yarn inherent chemical structure makes wool naturally flame resistant. It is a highly trusted natural fibre in public areas such as hotels, aircraft, hospitals and theatres.</h5>'),

There were several factors that contributed to the yarn industry decline.  Firstly, the Australian government began reducing the tariff protection in the footwear, clothing and textile industries in the 1970s, which opened the way for cheap imports to increasingly flood the Australian market. Now we all know that this affected all sectors of manufacturing. Prior to the removal of the tariffs, many larger towns in Australia had mills - it’s important to remember not all of these mills made yarn for the hand knitter, again this was a small proportion of the mills - many made fabrics, carpets, and yarns specifically for the manufacturing sector. It was the tariff reductions coupled with the changing directions worldwide of trends, that put our yarn industry into serious damage control.  In the 1980s people began to turn their back on handicrafts viewing them as old fashioned; a bit daggy. Pattern and yarn sales slumped, and many local yarn stores closed. You could also, for the first time, buy a machine-knitted jumper for cheaper than you could knit one.</h5>'),

(1, 'ROTATIONAL GRAZING', 'WHY SHOULD I USE IT?', 'Rotational grazing can express much higher stocking rates of paddock-by-paddock than regular pre-set stocking. It enhances the nutritious level of the grazing plants in the best growth stage of their lifecycle, therefore enabling multiple livestock to be able to continue their thriving. Using this technique, you can maintain your land forage as high productive pasture which extends the period of balanced growth. At the same time, compared to continuous grazing, you can decrease the methane emissions from livestock by up to 22% (per unit of cattle gain). In this case, cows will have more energy to produce milk.', 'cow_life.png', 'management_intensive_grazing.jpeg;mod_grazing.jpeg;adaptive_high_stock_density_grazing.jpeg', 'DIFFERENT ROTATIONAL GRAZING METHODS', 'Slow Rotational;Mob;Adaptive High-Stock Density', 'Slow rotational grazing is pastures of 2 or more with standard moves from every 2 weeks to every few months in order to enable land recovery and rest.;Requires significantly higher stock densities between 75-300+ AU per acre. Multiple moves per day are required to maintain ideal stock densities. Temporary fencing is often used to create small paddocks.;Apply multiple of the previous methods of grazing to enable graziers to adjust herd density to achieve the nutritional needs of livestock and satisfy the conditions of the soil.'),
(2, 'SEASONAL GRAZING', 'WHY SHOULD I USE IT?', 'Different season conditions provide different use of land for certain species. The benefits and disadvantages of seasonal grazing on the grassland can be very different based on the season you selected. Seasonal grazing offers a great chance to adjust your grazing regime of the year. It can benefit the targeted flora species in the habitat for better effectivity in the long-term.', '', 'autumn.jpeg;winter.jpeg;spring.jpeg;summer.jpeg', '', 'Autumn;Winter;Spring;Summer', 'The most suitable time to apply heavy grazing combined with a rotational or continuous technique.;It is a chance that you can adjust your whole year grazing regime.;Not the most appropriate time for effective grazing. It is better to keep relatively light grazing.;Not the best time. Light grazing is a more ideal option.'),
(3, 'PATCH-BURN GRAZING', 'WHY SHOULD I USE IT?', 'Patch-burn is a good technique that you can apply in your sustainable grazing. It helps to manage the grassland through burning certain areas of the paddock in a certain year to attract the grazing livestock. Thus, livestock will focus on grazing in the specific burned patch across the whole paddock. The rest of the portion of the grassland will be shifted for the new burning. In this way, always using the most recent burned section enable the regrowth and recovery of those already burned and used patches.', '', '', '', '', '');
