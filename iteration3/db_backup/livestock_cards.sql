The feed is typically a combination of grass, grain, and a mixture of other ingredients like citrus pulp, almond hulls and cotton seeds. These are items that may otherwise be thrown away.

Permanent grassland farms can generally keep up with fodder-crop farms, even in an intensive production setting. However, extensively operating farms, especially those on permanent grassland, significantly lag behind in productivity.</h5>'),

Though, sheep are herbivores, which means their diet does not include meat. They typically eat seeds, grass and plants. Some sheep do not need much water. The desert bighorn sheep, for example, gets most of its water from eating plants. Like all ruminants, they have multi-chambered stomachs that are adapted to ferment cellulose before digestion. To completely digest their food, sheep will regurgitate their food into their mouths, rechew and swallow. This regurgitated food is called cud.</h5>'),

But the relationship of grasslands and rain is a complicated one. All types of grasslands need a certain amount of rain, but then again not too much rain, since that will cause them to transform into something else.</h5><p></p><h5 class=\"text-justify\">How much rain is too much rain? How much is too little? That depends on the type of grassland and its location, but grasslands in general get around 50 to 90 centimeters of annual rainfall. Some grasslands also exist in areas where the annual rainfall exceeds 120 centimeters annually, and some exist in areas where there is as little as 25 centimeters of annual rainfall.</h5>'),

The record was set at the Wellington Show 2010 in Wellington, New South Wales on 1 May 2010. Wool fibers are very durable and flexible. Wool fiber can withstand being bent 20,000 times without breaking. In comparison, cotton breaks after 3,000 bends and silk after 2,000 bends. Also, Sheep wool has an incredible, natural UV protection built right in, which helps to keep sheep and lambs from getting sunburnt.</h5>'),

Australia’s 7.7 million square kilometres support a wide range of agricultural and forestry industries. Production from natural resources earns over $38 billion a year in exports from agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Competitive pressures drive the need for improved productivity, which includes increased diversification and intensification. These trends are occurring against a background of increased climate variability.</h5><p></p><h5 class=\"text-justify\">The way in which land is used has a profound effect on Australia’s social and ecological systems. There is a strong link between changes in land use and environmental, economic and social conditions. Information on land use and management is fundamental to understanding landscapes, agricultural production and the management of natural resources.</h5>'),

The differences and impacts are significant.', 'Grass fed or grain fed beef?', '<img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"images/livestock_stats/meat-card-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Grass fed or grain fed beef?\"><h5 class=\"text-justify\">Grass fed beef meat comes from cattle that have only grazed on grass. They feed on a range of different types of grasses, depending on climate and region. In Australia, cattle are predominantly grass fed and account for around 2/3 of whole beef production on average. Grain fed beef comes from cattle which are fed grass for most of their lives and then transition to grain-based diets for the remainder of their lives. The number of days during which they are fed a grain-based diet varies.</h5><p></p><h5 class=\"text-justify\">Livestock are fed grain for several reasons, including to maintain a consistent meat supply, improve eating quality, meet specific needs for niche markets (e.g. for highly marbled meat), meet the energy needs of animals when pasture is limited (such as in drought conditions) and increase animal size.</h5>'),

The major group to make the changes!', 'People make a difference', '<img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"images/livestock_stats/meat-card-2.jpeg\" alt=\"People make a difference\"><h5 class=\"text-justify\">There are 41,800 agricultural businesses maintained in the cattle industry and 26.4 million head of cattle in Australia as of 2017-2018. Around 172,000 people are employed in the red meat industry, including on-farm production, processing and retail. In 2018-2019, Australia produced approximately 2.35 million tones carcass weight (cwt) of beef and veal. In 2018-2019, 3.14 million grain fed cattle were marketed 38% of all adult cattle slaughtered. On the other hand, the gross value of Australian cattle and calf production (including live cattle exports) in 2018-19 is estimated at A$10.9 billion. Cattle contributed 18% of the total farm value of A$61.4 billion in 2018-2019.</h5>'),

Wool-made yarn is also one of the most sought after recycled textiles for converting into new long-lasting products, such as garments, mattresses and upholstery. In contrast to synthetics, wool-made yarn can absorb moisture vapour which means less sweat on your body.  Wool-made yarn even absorbs the odour molecules from sweat, which are only released upon washing. Wool-made yarn inherent chemical structure makes wool naturally flame resistant. It is a highly trusted natural fibre in public areas such as hotels, aircraft, hospitals and theatres.</h5>'),
(34, 'Yarn', 'Few other reasons behind yarn decline.', 'Reasons behind yarn reduction', '<img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"images/livestock_stats/yarn-card-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><h5 class=\"text-justify\">The best wool goes to make suits and clothing, not yarn. There were several factors that contributed to the yarn industry decline.  Firstly, the Australian government began reducing the tariff protection in the footwear, clothing and textile industries in the 1970s, which opened the way for cheap imports to increasingly flood the Australian market. Now we all know that this affected all sectors of manufacturing. Prior to the removal of the tariffs, many larger towns in Australia had mills - it’s important to remember not all of these mills made yarn for the hand knitter, again this was a small proportion of the mills - many made fabrics, carpets, and yarns specifically for the manufacturing sector. It was the tariff reductions coupled with the changing directions worldwide of trends, that put our yarn industry into serious damage control.  In the 1980s people began to turn their back on handicrafts viewing them as old fashioned; a bit daggy. Pattern and yarn sales slumped, and many local yarn stores closed. You could also, for the first time, buy a machine-knitted jumper for cheaper than you could knit one.</h5>'),
