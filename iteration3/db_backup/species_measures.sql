(4, 'flaticon-plow', 'plants', '<b>Manual removal</b> and <b>ploughing in</b> are the methods that can be used on the daily basis. While manual removal is suitable against small areas, ploughing is useful against wide areas. However, <i>ploughing cannot be done during the wet weather and can cause soil erosion.</i>'),

(8, 'flaticon-trap', 'animals', '<b>Traps</b> can be used to catch animals. It is advised to use grain as a bait to attract animals or place them around watering holes. This method is effective against feral pigs and goats. Traps need to be checked daily, so they are <i>ineffective against wide areas.</i>'),
(9, 'flaticon-poison', 'animals', '<b>Poison</b> can be used to control feral pigs, rabbits, and foxes. This method needs to be used with caution because <i>there are risks of poisoning non-targeted animals, livestock or plants.</i>');
