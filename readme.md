## Project description

Responsive mobile website developed by the Monash University students for the 'FIT5120 Industry Experience 
Studio Project' unit based on the Bootstrap 4 platform. The root cause of the problem has been researched 
from scratch based on the information provided online. Developers tried their best to utilise copyright/royalty-free 
resources. No help was provided by anyone since this problem is relatively new in Australia. In total, the project consisted 
of 3 iterations in 3 months.
	
## Project iterations

### [Iteration 1](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration1)

* Latest news regarding grazing, wildfires, drought, and livestock. These newsâ€™ are the latest possible and can be 
filtered based on the country and sorted by date. Few bugs are present here, which are fixed later on in iterations 2 and 3.
* Grazing techniques that need to be avoided/utilized by the farmers. Animated images, developed by us, are provided with 
the quick bullet-point information. Users can read additional information regarding these techniques and can download brochures.

### [Iteration 2](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration2)

* Improvements: bug fixes of iteration 1. Iteration 1 content has no visible change due to not keeping track of this change.
* Livestock statistics page contains the facts regarding the current livestock situation in Australia based on the dataset retrieved 
from [Australian Government Data.Gov.Au](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-1f3da692-f0cf-4de4-a7d3-bae52d600bae/details). Users are 
given the option to sort the analysis based on the livestock. Additionally, we have provided predictions of what is going to happen in 
the future (like years 2030-2060). On top of that, various fact calculations are done based on the data (like beef, milk, wool, etc. remaining). 
Additionally, the user can view the graph.
* Employment statistics show the current employment situation of farmers responsible for dairy or beef cattle, or sheep livestock. Employment numbers are shown by state. 
The highest qualification and age groups are provided. The datasets were retrieved from: [Australian Government Joboutlook 1](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/dairy-cattle-farmers?occupationCode=121313),
[Australian Government Joboutlook 2](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/beef-cattle-farmers?occupationCode=121312), and 
[Australian Government Joboutlook 3](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/sheep-farmers?occupationCode=121322). Additionally, 
analysis & URLs to various agricultural communities, where farmers can communicate with other farmers, are provided.

### [Iteration 3](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration3)

* Lots of improvements to iterations 1 and 2. Various bug fixes and UX improvements. Mobile version is completely user friendly now on both mobile and desktop devices.
* The drought page contains locations of drought based on the rainfall (mm). Users can learn what seasons are usually affected by drought. The dataset was retrieved from 
[Australian Governement Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/). Additionally, farmers can learn how drought impacts grassland, what the government does to assist them (with URLs to government 
dedicated websites), and what they can do to protect themselves. 
* The invasive species page contains various species (plants & animals). Farmers can know what impact do these species have on grassland and their livestock. 
Additionally, farmers can learn preventative measures against them and what states in Australia are infested by these species. Plant and animal datasets were 
retrieved from [WeedsAustralia](https://weeds.org.au/) and [Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment](https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive-species/feral-animals-australia). 
On top of that, users can download brochures of the preventative measures for their convenience.
