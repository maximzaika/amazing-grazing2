## 3.0 Project description

Responsive mobile website developed by the Monash University students for the 'FIT5120 Industry Experience 
Studio Project' unit based on the Bootstrap 4 platform. The root cause of the problem has been researched 
from scratch based on the information provided online. Developers tried their best to utilise copyright/royalty-free 
resources. No help was provided by anyone since this problem is relatively new in Australia. In total, the project consisted 
of 3 iterations in 3 months.
	
## 4.0 Project iterations

### 4.1 [Iteration 1](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration1)

* Latest news regarding grazing, wildfires, drought, and livestock. These newsâ€™ are the latest possible and can be 
filtered based on the country and sorted by date. Few bugs are present here, which are fixed later on in iterations 2 and 3.
* Grazing techniques that need to be avoided/utilized by the farmers. Animated images, developed by us, are provided with 
the quick bullet-point information. Users can read additional information regarding these techniques and can download brochures.

### 4.2 [Iteration 2](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration2)

* Improvements: bug fixes of iteration 1. Iteration 1 content has no visible change due to not keeping track of this change.
* Livestock statistics page contains the facts regarding the current livestock situation in Australia based on the dataset retrieved 
from [Australian Government Data.Gov.Au](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-1f3da692-f0cf-4de4-a7d3-bae52d600bae/details). Users are 
given the option to sort the analysis based on the livestock. Additionally, we have provided predictions of what is going to happen in 
the future (like years 2030-2060). On top of that, various fact calculations are done based on the data (like beef, milk, wool, etc. remaining). 
Additionally, the user can view the graph.
* Employment statistics show the current employment situation of farmers responsible for dairy or beef cattle, or sheep livestock. Employment numbers are shown by state. 
The highest qualification and age groups are provided. The datasets were retrieved from: [Australian Government Joboutlook 1](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/dairy-cattle-farmers?occupationCode=121313),
[Australian Government Joboutlook 2](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/beef-cattle-farmers?occupationCode=121312), and 
[Australian Government Joboutlook 3](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/sheep-farmers?occupationCode=121322). Additionally, 
analysis & URLs to various agricultural communities, where farmers can communicate with other farmers, are provided.

### 4.3 [Iteration 3](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration3)

* Lots of improvements to iterations 1 and 2. Various bug fixes and UX improvements. Mobile version is completely user friendly now on both mobile and desktop devices.
* The drought page contains locations of drought based on the rainfall (mm). Users can learn what seasons are usually affected by drought. The dataset was retrieved from 
[Australian Governement Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/). Additionally, farmers can learn how drought impacts grassland, what the government does to assist them (with URLs to government 
dedicated websites), and what they can do to protect themselves. 
* The invasive species page contains various species (plants & animals). Farmers can know what impact do these species have on grassland and their livestock. 
Additionally, farmers can learn preventative measures against them and what states in Australia are infested by these species. Plant and animal datasets were 
retrieved from [WeedsAustralia](https://weeds.org.au/) and [Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment](https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive-species/feral-animals-australia). 
On top of that, users can download brochures of the preventative measures for their convenience.

	#### 6.1.1 Edit content
  
	- Option 1: directly modify the table `nav_bar` in the MySQL
	- Option 2: open `../db_backup/nav_bar.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL

	#### 6.1.2 Make direct changes to HTML/PHP code
  
	- Open `../php/navigation.php` in notepad, read comments, modify the content, save it, and reload the page
	  
### Configure the headers of every page

### Configure & set up the Feedback floating button:

- How does it work and where does it go?
  - HTML generation of the interface is explained below.
  - When user clicks send, javascript `../js/amazing-grazing/feedback.js` catches the click of a `feedback-form form`, then uses function `.ajax()` to access `../php/feedback.php` server file, which then compares
	the tokens (read more below) to ensure that the sender is authorized, and uses sql query to write to MySQL database table called `user_feedback`
- The following code needs to be inside the page **(Add when creating a new page ONLY)**:
  - Add the following line to the `<body>` of the webpage: 
	```php
	<?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode(feedbackRead(basename(__FILE__, '.php')));?>
	```
  - Add the following code to the top of the webpage before `<html>`:
	```php
	<?php 
	  session_start();
	  if (empty($_SESSION['csrf_token'])) {
		$_SESSION['csrf_token'] = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
	  }
	?>
	```
  - Add the following code to the top of the webpage inside the `<head>` section (used for sending tokens between the client and server to verify the identity):
	```html
	<meta name="csrf-token" content="<?php $_SESSION['csrf_token']; echo $_SESSION['csrf_token']; ?>">
	```
  - Add the following scripts to the bottom of the `<body>` section:
	```html
	<script src="js/amazing-grazing/feedback.js"></script>
	<script src='https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js'></script>
	```
  - The HTML is generated via .PHP file. To modify it, open `../php/generate-feedback-tab.php` in notepad, read comments, perform direct manipulations, save the file, and reload the page
	  
### Configure & set up the floating back to top button located on every page. 

- **Perform these actions when creating a new page ONLY**
- Add the following line to the bottom of the `<body>` section before `<scripts>`:
```html
<div class="scrollToTop js-top"><a href="" class="js-gotop"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div>
```
- Add the following script to the bottom of the `<body>` section:
```html
<script src="js/amazing-grazing/main.js"></script>
```
- `Scroll to top button...` section of `../js/amazing-grazing/main.js` file is responsible for the back to top button

### Index.php page

- Modify the `SERVICES` section:
  - To modify the HEADER and SUBHEADER: 1) directly access `index.php` file in notepad, 2) scroll down to `SERVICES` section 3) modify directly
  - To modify cards:
	- Ensure that the the following line is inside the `SERVICES CARDS` section (it is used to retrieved content from the database):
	  ```php
	  <?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode(generateOfferings2($con));?>
	  ```
	- Content can be modified via the database:
	  - Option 1: directly modify `index_offerings` table in MySQL
	  - Option 2: open `../db_backup/index_offerings.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL
	- Make direct changes to HTML/PHP code:
	  - Open`../php/home_offerings.php` in notepad, read comments, modify the content, save it, and reload the page

### Livestock-statistics.php page

- Modify the spinner to the left side of the "LIVESTOCK REDUCTION IMPACTS GRASSLANDS":
  - Ensure that the the following line is inside the "Spinner containing livestock, beef..." section (it is used to retrieve content from the database):
	```php
	<?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode($spinner_full);?>
	```
  - Javascript file, responsible for rotations and calculations, must be added to the bottom of the `<body>` section:
	```javascript
	<script src="js/amazing-grazing/animated-spinner.js"></script>
	```
  - Content can be modified via the database:
	- Option 1: directly modify `livestock_spinner` table in MySQL
	- Option 2: open `../db_backup/livestock_spinner.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL
  - The HTML is generated via .PHP file. To modify it, open `../php/livestock-statistics-content.php` in notepad, read comments, refer to section 1) Spinner, perform manipulations, save the file, and reload the page
- Modify the "LIVESTOCK REDUCTION IMPACTS GRASSLANDS" section:
  - Ensure that the the following line is inside the "Livestock reduction impacts..." section (it is used to retrieve content from the database):
	```php
	<?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode($live_intro);?>
	```
  - To modify HEADER, SUBHEADER, and CONTENT:
	- Option 1: directly modify `livestock_landing` table in MySQL
	- Option 2: open `../db_backup/livestock_landing.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL
  - The HTML is generated via .PHP file. To modify it, open `../php/livestock-statistics-content.php` in notepad, read comments, refer to section 2) Intro, perform manipulations, save the file, and reload the page
- Modify the "CONSEQUENCES OF LIVESTOCK REDUCTION IN THE FUTURE":
  - How does it work?
	- On page load:
	  1. The script at the bottom of the page (refer to comments) automatically simulates the click on the year set by default.
	  2. This click triggers javascript function `yearSelection` in `js/amazing-grazing/livestock-prediction.js` file. 
	  3. This function calls function `.ajax()` to access the `../php/prediction_POST.php` file to receive cards content from MySQL database, updates the data base on the year & filters selected, calculates
		 facts using fomulas, decides what cards to show.
		  - `../php/prediction_POST.php` accesses the following tables in MySQL database: `livestock_prediction_dataset` and `livestock_cards`
	- Click on year selection:
	  1. Year selection triggers javascript function `yearSelection` in `js/amazing-grazing/livestock-prediction.js` file. 
	  2. Same as point (c or 3) above
	- Click on filter selection:
	  1. Filter selection options trigger javascript function `selectLivestock` in `js/amazing-grazing/livestock-picker.js` file.
	  2. This function identifies active/inactive buttons, unchecks all other buttons if TOTAL button is clicked, sends error if all buttons are inactive, and simulates click on the year (Refer to above section On page load b-c (or 2-3)).
	- Click on display graph:
	  1. Triggers function at the bottom of the webpage related to the "display graph" id `#hide-graph`.
	  2. This function clears the place where graph is supposed to go,  identifies filter parameters and year, calls function `.ajax()` to access `../php/livestock-graph.php` file to receive various urls, ids, etc. 
		 related to tableau, then uses this data to create a graph.
		  -  `../php/livestock-graph.php` accesses the `livestock_graph` table in MySQL database
  - Modify the HEADER and SUBHEADER: 1) directly access `livestock-statistics.php` file in notepad, 2) scroll down to "CONSEQUENCES OF LIVESTOCK..." section, and 3) modify directly
  - Modify SORT options: 1) directly access `livestock-statistics.php` file in notepad, 2) scroll down to "Sorting" section, and 3) modify directly
  - Add/modify/remove tableau graphs:
	- Option 1: directly modify `livestock_graph` table in MySQL
	- Option 2: open `../db_backup/livestock_graph.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL
  - Add/modify/remove card content:
	- Option 1: directly modify `livestock_cards` table in MySQL 
	- Option 2: open `../db_backup/livestock_cards.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL
  - To modify card HTML (*If necessary ONLY*):
    - Open `../js/amazing-grazing/livestock-prediction.js`, scroll down to function `contentHTML()`, perform modifications, save, and refresh the page.
  - Livestock tableau graphs and datasets:
	- Livestock datasets can be accessed by going to `../dataset_and_tablleau/datasets-livestock-statistics/`:
	  - File 1: `livestock_year_1973_2016.xlsx` is the original datasets. It is not in database and not used.
	  - File 2: `livestock_year_2017_2060.xlsx` is the predicted dataset based on the previous dataset. It is stored in `livestock_prediction_dataset` database table.
	- Livestock tableau graphs:
	  - Website has many graphs related to various filters for years. Tableau is used to generated these line graphs. 
	  - Tableau server is required to be installed on your local machine to modify the tableau files.
	  - Go to `../dataset_and_tableau/tableau-livestock-statistics/` folder, and select the graph needed for modifications.
	  - Perform modifications to the graphs referring to [Tableau Documentation](https://www.tableau.com/), then publish this graph publickly, and retrieve required content. Refer to **"How to post graphs?"** of this section to learn more.
