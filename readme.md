## 3.0 Project description

Responsive mobile website developed by the Monash University students for the 'FIT5120 Industry Experience 
Studio Project' unit based on the Bootstrap 4 platform. The root cause of the problem has been researched 
from scratch based on the information provided online. Developers tried their best to utilise copyright/royalty-free 
resources. No help was provided by anyone since this problem is relatively new in Australia. In total, the project consisted 
of 3 iterations in 3 months.
	
## 4.0 Project iterations

### 4.1 [Iteration 1](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration1)

* Latest news regarding grazing, wildfires, drought, and livestock. These newsâ€™ are the latest possible and can be 
filtered based on the country and sorted by date. Few bugs are present here, which are fixed later on in iterations 2 and 3.
* Grazing techniques that need to be avoided/utilized by the farmers. Animated images, developed by us, are provided with 
the quick bullet-point information. Users can read additional information regarding these techniques and can download brochures.

### 4.2 [Iteration 2](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration2)

* Improvements: bug fixes of iteration 1. Iteration 1 content has no visible change due to not keeping track of this change.
* Livestock statistics page contains the facts regarding the current livestock situation in Australia based on the dataset retrieved 
from [Australian Government Data.Gov.Au](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-1f3da692-f0cf-4de4-a7d3-bae52d600bae/details). Users are 
given the option to sort the analysis based on the livestock. Additionally, we have provided predictions of what is going to happen in 
the future (like years 2030-2060). On top of that, various fact calculations are done based on the data (like beef, milk, wool, etc. remaining). 
Additionally, the user can view the graph.
* Employment statistics show the current employment situation of farmers responsible for dairy or beef cattle, or sheep livestock. Employment numbers are shown by state. 
The highest qualification and age groups are provided. The datasets were retrieved from: [Australian Government Joboutlook 1](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/dairy-cattle-farmers?occupationCode=121313),
[Australian Government Joboutlook 2](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/beef-cattle-farmers?occupationCode=121312), and 
[Australian Government Joboutlook 3](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/sheep-farmers?occupationCode=121322). Additionally, 
analysis & URLs to various agricultural communities, where farmers can communicate with other farmers, are provided.

### 4.3 [Iteration 3](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration3)

* Lots of improvements to iterations 1 and 2. Various bug fixes and UX improvements. Mobile version is completely user friendly now on both mobile and desktop devices.
* The drought page contains locations of drought based on the rainfall (mm). Users can learn what seasons are usually affected by drought. The dataset was retrieved from 
[Australian Governement Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/). Additionally, farmers can learn how drought impacts grassland, what the government does to assist them (with URLs to government 
dedicated websites), and what they can do to protect themselves. 
* The invasive species page contains various species (plants & animals). Farmers can know what impact do these species have on grassland and their livestock. 
Additionally, farmers can learn preventative measures against them and what states in Australia are infested by these species. Plant and animal datasets were 
retrieved from [WeedsAustralia](https://weeds.org.au/) and [Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment](https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive-species/feral-animals-australia). 
On top of that, users can download brochures of the preventative measures for their convenience.

		define('DB_USERNAME', 'add-MySQL-username-here');
		define('DB_PASSWORD', 'add-MySQL-password-here');
		define('DB_NAME', 'add-table-from-MySQL-here');
	
		$con = mysqli_connect(DB_SERVER, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME);
	
		if ($con -> connect_error) {
			die("Connection failed: " . $con->connect_error);
		}
	  ?>
	  ```
      - Modify `DB_SERVER` (server name), `DB_USERNAME` (username to access the database), `DB_PASSWORD` (password to access the database), and `DB_NAME` (table name)
    - Go to `../db_backup/full_db_backup`. Import `amazing-grazing.sql` file to MySQL database

## 6.0 Configure identical parts of every page

### 6.1 Configure the navigation bar

#### 6.1.1 Edit content

- Option 1: directly modify the table `nav_bar` in the MySQL
- Option 2: open `../db_backup/nav_bar.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL

#### 6.1.2 Make direct changes to HTML/PHP code

- Open `../php/navigation.php` in notepad, read comments, modify the content, save it, and reload the page
	  
### 6.2 Configure the headers of every page

1. Headers are not stored in the database. To modify the images or text, open any of the web page file using notepad.
2. Go to commented out section called `Page header`, make direct modifications, save them, and reload the page
	
### 6.3 Configure the footers/license of every page

1. Footers are not stored in the database. To modify the content, open any of the web page file using notepad.
2. Go to commented out section called `Footer` or `License`, make direct modifications, save them, and reload the page

### 6.4 Configure breadcrumbs

1. Open any of the webpages other than `index.php` (it is not on this page)
2. Go to commented out section called `Breadcrumbs`, make direct modifications, save them, and reload the page
	
### 6.5 Configure & set up the Feedback floating button

#### 6.5.1 How does it work and where does it go?

- HTML generation of the interface is explained below.
- When user clicks send, javascript `../js/amazing-grazing/feedback.js` catches the click of a `feedback-form form`, then uses function `.ajax()` to access `../php/feedback.php` server file, which then compares
the tokens (read more below) to ensure that the sender is authorized, and uses sql query to write to MySQL database table called `user_feedback`

#### 6.5.2 The following code needs to be inside the page

**Note:** Perform these actions when creating a new page ONLY 
- Add the following line to the `<body>` of the webpage: 
```php
<?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode(feedbackRead(basename(__FILE__, '.php')));?>
```
- Add the following code to the top of the webpage before `<html>`:
```php
<?php 
  session_start();
  if (empty($_SESSION['csrf_token'])) {
	$_SESSION['csrf_token'] = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
  }
?>
```
- Add the following code to the top of the webpage inside the `<head>` section (used for sending tokens between the client and server to verify the identity):
```html
<meta name="csrf-token" content="<?php $_SESSION['csrf_token']; echo $_SESSION['csrf_token']; ?>">
```
- Add the following scripts to the bottom of the `<body>` section:
```html
<script src="js/amazing-grazing/feedback.js"></script>
<script src='https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js'></script>
```
- The HTML is generated via .PHP file. To modify it, open `../php/generate-feedback-tab.php` in notepad, read comments, perform direct manipulations, save the file, and reload the page
	  
### 6.6 Configure & set up the floating back to top button

**Note:** Perform these actions when creating a new page ONLY 
- Add the following line to the bottom of the `<body>` section before `<scripts>`:
```html
<div class="scrollToTop js-top"><a href="" class="js-gotop"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div>
```
- Add the following script to the bottom of the `<body>` section:
```html
<script src="js/amazing-grazing/main.js"></script>
```
- `Scroll to top button...` section of `../js/amazing-grazing/main.js` file is responsible for the back to top button

### 6.7 Configure tableau graphs

**Note:** Perform these actions if necessary ONLY
- Tableau graphs are located on the `livestock-statistics.php`, `employment-statistics.php`, `drought.php`, and `invasive-species.php` pages
- Tableau server needs to be installed on the local machine to perform modifications (refer to [Tableau documentation](https://www.tableau.com/) to learn more)

Instructions:

1. Go to the folder `dataset_and_tableau` and select any of the folders related to your page:
    - Folder `tableau-drought`
    - Folder `tableau-employment-statistics`
    - Folder `tableau-invasive-species`
    - Folder `tableau-livestock-statistics`
2. Open any of the tableau files (with `.twb` extension) in any of the folders mentioned above, modify, and publish as public
3. Open the tableau page where your public graph is located, click on the "share" button, copy and paste "Embed Code" in some other `.txt` editor
4. Retrieve `id` of the first `<div>` container, retrieve `src` of the `<img>` container, `value` of the `<param name='name'>` container, and `value` of the `<param name='static_image'>` container
5. Refer to the following sections related to the dedicated webpages to learn where to insert content retrieved in step 4

## 7.0 Configure index.php page

### 7.1 Modify the SERVICES section

- To modify the HEADER and SUBHEADER: 1) directly access `index.php` file in notepad, 2) scroll down to `SERVICES` section 3) modify directly
- To modify cards:
- Ensure that the the following line is inside the `SERVICES CARDS` section (it is used to retrieved content from the database):
  ```php
  <?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode(generateOfferings2($con));?>
  ```
- Content can be modified via the database:
  - Option 1: directly modify `index_offerings` table in MySQL
  - Option 2: open `../db_backup/index_offerings.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL
- Make direct changes to HTML/PHP code:
  - Open`../php/home_offerings.php` in notepad, read comments, modify the content, save it, and reload the page

## 8.0 Configure livestock-statistics.php page

### 8.1 Modify the spinner

#### 8.1.1 Spinner content

- Option 1: directly modify `livestock_spinner` table in MySQL
- Option 2: open `../db_backup/livestock_spinner.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL

#### 8.1.2 Spinner content in HTML
1. Ensure that the the following line is inside the "Spinner containing livestock, beef..." section (it is used to retrieve content from the database) of the `livestock-statistics.php`:
   ```php
   <?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode($spinner_full);?>
   ```
2. Open `../php/livestock-statistics-content.php` in notepad, read comments, refer to section "1) Spinner", perform manipulations, save the file, and reload the page

#### 8.1.3 Javascript spinner animated-spinner.js
- The following javascript file is responsible for the spinner execution on load of the page (located at the bottom of the `<body>` section:
  ```javascript
  <script src="js/amazing-grazing/animated-spinner.js"></script>
  ```  
**Note:** each time page is resized, it needs to be refreshed to ensure that the spinner fits the screen size - **suggested future improvement**. Refer to the file to read more.

### 8.2 Modify the LIVESTOCK REDUCTION IMPACTS GRASSLANDS section

- Ensure that the the following line is inside the "Livestock reduction impacts..." section (it is used to retrieve content from the database):
```php
<?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode($live_intro);?>
```
- To modify HEADER, SUBHEADER, and CONTENT:
- Option 1: directly modify `livestock_landing` table in MySQL
- Option 2: open `../db_backup/livestock_landing.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL
- The HTML is generated via .PHP file. To modify it, open `../php/livestock-statistics-content.php` in notepad, read comments, refer to section 2) Intro, perform manipulations, save the file, and reload the page

### 8.3 Modify the CONSEQUENCES OF LIVESTOCK REDUCTION IN THE FUTURE section

#### 8.3.1 How does it work?

- On page load:
  1. The script at the bottom of the page (refer to comments) automatically simulates the click on the year set by default.
  2. This click triggers javascript function `yearSelection` in `js/amazing-grazing/livestock-prediction.js` file. 
  3. This function calls function `.ajax()` to access the `../php/prediction_POST.php` file to receive cards content from MySQL database, updates the data base on the year & filters selected, calculates
	 facts using fomulas, decides what cards to show.
	  - `../php/prediction_POST.php` accesses the following tables in MySQL database: `livestock_prediction_dataset` and `livestock_cards`
- Click on year selection:
  1. Year selection triggers javascript function `yearSelection` in `js/amazing-grazing/livestock-prediction.js` file. 
  2. Same as point (c or 3) above
- Click on filter selection:
  1. Filter selection options trigger javascript function `selectLivestock` in `js/amazing-grazing/livestock-picker.js` file.

## 9.0 Configure employment-statistics.php page

### 9.1 Modify FARMERS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, video, and image section

### 9.1.1 Modify content

Both headers, subheaders, content, image, and video can be modified through MySQL database:
- Option 1: directly modify `emp_landing` table in MySQL
- Option 2: open `../db_backup/emp_landing.sql` in notepad, modify the content, and import it to MySQL

### 9.1.2 Modify in HTML

**Note:** Perform operations if necessary ONLY
- `employment-statstics.php` contains `"Left and right sides (video & content) retrieved from db"` section that stores the following code (used to access the database and create HTML content):
  ```php
  <?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode($emp_landing);?>	
  ```
- Open `../php/employee-statistics-content.php` file in notepad, read the comments, scroll down to section `1) Landing`, perform changes, save, ane reload the page
  - Section `1) Landing` retrives the content directly from the database's table `emp_landing` and converts it to HTML

### 9.2 Modify NUMBERS OF EDUCATED & YOUNG FARMERS IS REDUCING section

#### 9.2.1 How does it work?

- On load:
  1. Click of the sort button `$(emp_type_select).trigger("click");` is simulated in the `<script>` section at the bottom of the `employment-statistics.php` page based on the `id` of the button selected by 
     default. Examples of ids: `#e-beef`, `#e-dairy`, and `#e-sheep`.
  2. These buttons have `.select-employment` class. Function `selectEmployment()` in the `../js/amazing-grazing/employment-picker.js` is listening for a click of this class, which is simulated in step 1.
  3. Once this function is triggered, it receives the `id` of step 1, and sends this `id` to function `selectEmploymentType()` in the same file.
  4. This function compares the `received id` with the `clicked id` and retrieves the content of the graph and its license (graph data and license are not stored in database - ***suggested improvement***).
  5. Then this function sends all the content of step 4 to the function `placeGraph()` in the same file, which generates the graph. This function inserts the graph into `employment-statistics.php` section that has 
     `id` set as `#tableau-chart`. Addtitionally sets license to a text box with `id` `#reference`
  6. Function `selectEmployment()` from step 2 continues execution and sends a request using function `.ajax()` to the server file `../php/employment-card-POST.php` to retrieve the content of all the cards in HTML format.
  7. It inserts HTML content directly to `employment-statistics.php` section that has `id` `cards-data`.  
  **Note:** refer to `../js/amazing-grazing/employment-picker.js` file to learn more in the commented out section.

- On sort button click:
  - Refer to 'On load step b (or 2)'

### 12.3 Modify INVASIVE SPECIES & LOCATIONS (GALLERY)

#### 12.3.1 How does it work?

- On load:
  1) `.ajax()` function (located at the bottom of `invasive-species.php` file) that accesses the server's `../php/invasive-species-gallery.php` file to
     retrieve the gallery content in HTML format from the database's table `species_types` and push it to `id` `#animals-content` (located in the `Gallery` section
	 of the `invasive-species.php`:
	 ```html
     <div class="col-md-12 sort-species-item filter-animals">
	    <div id="animals-content" class="carousel-species owl-carousel ftco-owl">
	       <!-- animals content goes here -->
	    </div>
     </div>
     ```
     - class `sort-species-item` is related to the `sort-species-flters` in step 3, which represents that everything within this class is treated as a sortable item.
  2) It also resizes the gallery items to make the height similar.
  3) It activates the carousel, sorting/filtering animations.
  
- On "Show affected areas" click;
  1) These buttons contain `.location-button` class, which is triggered upon users click.
  2) The modal with `id` `#tableau-chart` gets cleared just in case old graph is there
  3) **This part is done on load:** server file `../php/invasive-species-gallery-get-js.php` is executed that accesses `species_types` table once again to retrieve 
     graph/map content and license in the form of `javascript if-else statements` that are pushed to the javascript using the following php line:
	 ```php
	 <?php echo htmlspecialchars_decode($if_statement);?>
	 ```
  4) Content retrieved in step 3 is used to generate the graph, push it inside the `#tableau-chart`.
  5) Then this function generates the license container that goes below the graph.
  
**Note:** The following code of the "Sort" section is responsible for sorting the galleries:
   ```html
   <li data-filter=".filter-plants" class="filter-active">Plants</li>
   ```
   - `data-filter=".filter-plants"` assigns a unique identifier to an item, which gallery follows
   - `class="filter-active"` makes an item active by default. *You may exclude this line if the item is not active by default.*
   - `Plants` is the name of an item that user sees
