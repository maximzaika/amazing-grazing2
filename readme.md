## Project description

Responsive mobile website developed by the Monash University students for 'FIT5120 Industry Experience Studio Project' unit based on Bootstrap 4 platform.
 The root cause of the problem has been researched from scratch based on the information provided online.
 Developers tried their best to utilise copyright/royalty free resources. No help was provided by anyone since this problem is relatively new in Australia. 
 In total, project consisted of 3 iterations in the span of 3 months.
	
## Project itererations

### [Iteration 1](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration1)

* Latest news regarding grazing, wildfires, drought, and livestock. These news are the latest possible and can be filtered based on the coutnry 
and sorted by date. Few bugs are present here, which are fixed later on in iterations 2 and 3.
* Grazing techniques that need to be avoided/utilised by the farmers. Animated images, developed by us, are provided with the quick 
bullet point information. User can read additional information regarding these techniques and is able to download brouchers.

### [Iteration 2](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration2)

* Improvements: bug fixes of iteration 1. Iteration 1 content has no visible change due to not keeping track of this change.
* Livestock statistics page contains the facts regarding current livestock situation in Australia based on the dataset retrieved 
from [Australian Government Data.Gov.Au](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-1f3da692-f0cf-4de4-a7d3-bae52d600bae/details). Users are 
given option to sort the analysis based on the livestock. Additionally, we have provided predictions of what is going to happen in the future (like years 2030-2060).
On top of that, various fact calculations are done based on the data (like beef, milk, wool, etc. remaining). Additionally, user is able to view the graph.
* Employment statistics shows the current employment situation of farmers responsible for dairy or beef cattle, or sheep livestock. Employment numbers are shown by state. Highest qualification
and age groups are provided. The datasets were retrieved from: [Australian Government Joboutlook 1](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/dairy-cattle-farmers?occupationCode=121313),
[Australian Government Joboutlook 2](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/beef-cattle-farmers?occupationCode=121312), and 
[Australian Government Joboutlook 3](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/sheep-farmers?occupationCode=121322). Additionally, 
analysis & URLs to various agricultural communities, where farmers can communicate with other farmers, are provided.

### [Iteration 3](https://amazing-grazing.ml/iteration3)

* Lots of improvements to iterations 1 and 2. Various bug fixes and UX improvements. Mobile is completely user friendly now on both mobile and desktop devices.
* Drought page contains locations of drought based on the rainfall (mm). User can learn what seasons are usually affected by drought. The dataset was retrieved from 
[Australian Governement Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/). Additionally, farmers can learn how drought impacts grassland, what the government does to assist them (with URLs to government 
dedicated websites), and what they can do to protect themselves. 
* Invasive species page contains various species (plants & animals). Farmers can know what impact do these species have on grassland and their livestock. Additionally, farmers can learn
preventative measures against them and  what states in Australia are infested by these species. Plant and animal datasets ware retrieved 
from [WeedsAustralia](https://weeds.org.au/) and [Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment](https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive-species/feral-animals-australia). 
On top of that, users can download brochures of the prevantative measures for their convenience.
