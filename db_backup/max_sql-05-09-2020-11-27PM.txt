        'Rotational grazing can express much higher stocking rates of paddock-by-paddock than regular pre-set stocking. It enhances the nutritious level of the grazing plants in the best growth stage of their lifecycle, therefore enabling multiple livestock to be able to continue their thriving. Using this technique, you can maintain your land forage as high productive pasture which extends the period of balanced growth. At the same time, compared to continuous grazing, you can decrease the methane emissions from livestock by up to 22% (per unit of cattle gain). In this case, cows will have more energy to produce milk.',

Temporary fencing is often used to create small paddocks.;Apply multiple of the previous methods of grazing to enable graziers to adjust herd density to achieve the nutritional needs of livestock and satisfy the conditions of the soil.');
